Structure software in OpenCL
==================
This is the structure software. The purpose of this project is
to rewrite it so that it runs on GPUs using OpenCL. It is done as a project for Nýsköpunarsjóður Námsmanna, a research fund for university students administered by Rannsóknarmiðstöð Íslands, under the guidance of Páll Melsted.
