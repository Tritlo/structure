Structure software in OpenCL
==================
This is the structure software. The purpose of this project is
to rewrite it so that it runs on GPUs using OpenCL. It is done as a project for Nýsköpunarsjóður Námsmanna, a research fund for university students administered by Rannsóknarmiðstöð Íslands, under the guidance of Páll Melsteð.

The structure software website can be found at:

A license will be added later, when I've figured out what license structure is under, but structure is free and open source software, and this project will be as well.


Changes from structure:
